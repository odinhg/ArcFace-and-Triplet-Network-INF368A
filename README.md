## Todo

- Create triplet data loader
- Implement triplet loss
- Could do with some better config system allowing multiple models to be compared easily
- Remove files no longer needed from exercise 1


## Task 1
- Use same backbone as in exercise 1.
- Implement siamese network with triplet loss.
	- Read and understand exactly what to do
	- Create triplet loader
	- Create triplet loss
- Train model and report

## Task 2
- Same backbone, but implement CosFace, ArcFace or somthing like that.
- Train model and report

## Task 3 and 4
Embed data and report average distances (use appropriate distance measure)

## Task 5
Visualise representations using UMAP for both models

## Task 6
Display images close to center, far-away from center and closest images from other classes. For both models.

## Task 7
Train classifiers on embeddings only.
